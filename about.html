            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm currently studing math and computer science at Laney College in Oakland, with a lot of
            extra-curricular learning on the side. My primary interests are systems programming and 
            high-performance computing. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I originally studied linguistics at UC Berkeley, where I got my Bachelor's and Master's degrees.
            It was through linguistics I got my first exposure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">formal language theory</a>, 
            <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montague-semantics/#LogTra">lambda calculi</a>,
            <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/typelogical-grammar/">type theory</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/research/groups/llic/files/plurals.pdf">abstract</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)">algebra</a>. I've been hooked ever since. 
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition to my studies, I work as an in-home care provider to my nephew, who has special needs.
            As he gets older and needs me less, I am looking to transition into an engineering career.
