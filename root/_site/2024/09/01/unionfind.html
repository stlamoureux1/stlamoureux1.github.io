            <h2>Data Structures 1: Union-Find</h2>
<p>01 Sep 2024</p>

<p>Over Summer 2024, I participated in a seminar led by <a href="https://17070415.xyz/blog">Jenweil Yang</a> that was focused on applied data structures. Near the end, he asked that participants present on a data structure of interest to them, and suggested I present on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">Union-Find</a>. You can find my slides <a href="https://github.com/stlamoureux1/hosted_files/blob/main/UnionFind.pdf.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>The content was aimed at an audience with various levels of experience, so I spend some time there going over basic definitions for sets and graphs. Iâ€™m planning to follow this up with a post giving a more condensed run-down on the Union-Find, and eventually one on its sister, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_refinement">Partition Refinement</a>.</p>
