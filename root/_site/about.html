<p>I’m a non-traditional student in math and computer science at Laney College in Oakland. My primary interests are systems programming, C++, and high-performance computing. I’m currently seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025.</p>

<p>I originally studied linguistics at UC Berkeley, where I got my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
It was through linguistics I got my first exposure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">formal language theory</a>, 
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montague-semantics/#LogTra">lambda calculi</a>,
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/typelogical-grammar/">type theory</a>,
and <a href="https://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/research/groups/llic/files/plurals.pdf">abstract</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)">algebra</a>. I’ve been hooked ever since.</p>

<p>In addition to my studies, I work as an in-home care provider to my nephew, who has special needs.
As he gets older and needs me less, I’m transitioning into a career in engineering.</p>
